# Node.js Learning Projects

This repository contains all the projects I've developed to learn and deepen my knowledge of Node.js.
Here, you'll find everything from basic concepts to advanced topics such as TypeScript, npm, and API development.
Each project explores a new skill or builds upon previous concepts with the goal of establishing a solid foundation in Node.js.

## Project Structure

The projects are organized into folders based on the main topic covered. Each folder contains a specific `README.md` explaining the objectives and key lessons of each project.

### Content

- **Basic Node.js Concepts**: First steps with Node.js, including file handling, modules, and creating a basic server.
- **npm and Dependency Management**: Using npm for installation, updating, and dependency management, as well as best practices for creating `package.json`.
- **APIs with Node.js**: Creating APIs without any frameworks and with Express and Fastfy.
- **TypeScript with Node.js**: Projects that use TypeScript to add static typing and improve code quality, focusing on best practices.
